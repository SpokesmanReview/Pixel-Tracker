Django Pixel Tracker
==============

Django Pixel Tracker uses Django signals to publish usage data about single object views. You can use this data for internal and external use, such as:

* In-house analytics tracking (Maybe add a dashboard or track content in the Django admin?)
* "Most active" stories/blogposts/etc (This is the SR's use case).


Installation
------------

Add `pixel_tracker` to your installed apps:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...,
    'pixel_tracker',
    ...
)
```

Add `tracking_pixel` to your site urls:

```python
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ...,
    (r'^pixel/', include('pixel_tracker.urls')),
    ...,
)
```

Add pixel to your templates:


```html
{% load pixel %}
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        {% pixel %}
    </body>

</html>
```


Usage
-----

To use Django Pixel Tracker, you need create a receiver to subscribe to the `pixel_data` signal within your app. Example:

```python
from pixel_tracker.models import pixel_data

def simple_receiver(**kwargs):
    pixel_data = kwargs['pixel_data']
    pprint(pixel_data)

pixel_data.connect(simple_receiver)
```

In this example, it will simply print out the pixel data as a Python Dict, but you could store this data in your database, load it into Redis or send off a Celery task. What you do with it is up to you.

The default data that it collects is:

* Name of object model
* PK of object item
* Full url path of the request
* Timestamp

You could extend that with any data that is available in the context.
